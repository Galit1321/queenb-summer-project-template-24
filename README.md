# queenb-summer-project-template-24

This project template is designed for junior deevlopers aimed at gaining hands-on experience in full-stack development. 
This project includes a Node.js server with Express, a React client, and MongoDB for the database, providing an opportunity to engage in frontend development, backend development, and API integration.
Specifically the template is a full-stack MERN application for managing a library of rubber ducks - but you can modify it and build a library application of your choice.

**FORK THIS REPO** before starting the installations and settings.

## Configuration
### Setting Up MongoDB Atlas
only once per project.

#### Creating a New Database in MongoDB Atlas

see video toturial by Net Ninja - [Link](https://youtu.be/s0anSjEeua8?si=GAeglEfAuJmvoAtj)

1. **Sign Up / Log In to MongoDB Atlas**:
   - Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and sign up for a new account or log in if you already have one.

2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Once logged in, click on "Projects" in the left-hand menu.
   - Click on the "New Project" button.
   - Enter a project name, e.g., "LibraryProject", and click "Next".
   - Add your teamates as project members.
   - Click "create project".

3. **Create a New Cluster**:
   - Within your new project, click on "Create a Cluster".
   - Choose a cloud provider and region - choose the free plan and the AWS cloud provider.
   - Click "Create Deployment". This process might take a few minutes.

4. **Set Up Database Access**:
   - Once your cluster is created, you need to set up a user to access the database.
   - Click on the "Database Access" tab.
   - Click the "Add New Database User" button.
   - Create a user with a username and password. Make sure to note these down as you will need them later.
   - Set the user's permissions to "Read and write to any database".

5. **Network Access**:
   - Click on the "Network Access" tab.
   - Click the "Add IP Address" button.
   - Add your current IP address or allow access from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) if you're just testing. Be cautious with security when using the latter option.

6. **Create a Database**:
   - Click on the "Database" tab.
   - Click the "Browse Collections" button next to your cluster.
   - Click "Create Database".
   - Enter a database name, e.g., "libraryDB", and a collection name, e.g., "ducks".
   - Click "Create".

7. **Connect to Your Cluster**:
   - Go back to the "Database" tab.
   - Click the "Connect" button next to your cluster.
   - Choose "Connect your application".
   - Copy the connection string. It will look something like this:
     ```
     mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/libraryDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     ```

8. **Update Your .env File**:
   - In your `server` directory, create a `.env` file if it doesn't already exist.
   - Add your MongoDB connection string to the `.env` file, replacing `<username>` and `<password>` with your database user credentials:
     ```env
     MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/libraryDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     ```

#### Testing the Connection
1. Start the Server:

  * Navigate to the server directory:
```bash
cd server
```
  * Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

  * Verify Connection:
  Check the terminal for a message indicating a successful connection to MongoDB.

By following these steps, you will have a MongoDB Atlas database set up and connected to your MERN stack application. 


### Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to configure your application without hardcoding sensitive information into your code. For this project, you need to set up the following environment variables in a `.env` file located in the `server` directory:

1. **MONGO_URI**: This variable contains the connection string for your MongoDB database. It tells your server where to find the database and how to connect to it. You will get this connection string from MongoDB Atlas when you set up your database.

2. **PORT**: This variable defines the port on which your Express server will run. By default, this is set to `5000`, but you can change it to any available port number.

#### How to Set Up Your `.env` File

1. **Create a `.env` File**:
   - Navigate to the `server` directory:
     ```bash
     cd server
     ```
   - Create a file named `.env` if it does not already exist.

2. **Add the Environment Variables**:
   - Open the `.env` file in a text editor.
   - Add the following lines, replacing placeholders with your actual values:

     ```env
     MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/libraryDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     PORT=5000
     ```

   - Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with the credentials you created for your MongoDB Atlas database.
   - `libraryDB` should be replaced with the name of your database if different.
   - You can change `5000` to any port number you prefer.

3. **Save the File**:
   - Save the `.env` file after adding the necessary environment variables.

#### Example `.env` File

Here is an example of what your `.env` file might look like:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://myUser:myPassword@cluster0.mongodb.net/myDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
PORT=5000
```

## Usage

This section explains how to use the application once itâ€™s set up and running. Follow these steps to interact with both the client and server components of the application.

### Running the Server

1. **Navigate to the Server Directory**:
   - Open a terminal and change to the `server` directory:
     ```bash
     cd server
     ```

2. **Start the Server**:
   - Start the Express server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - By default, the server will run on `http://localhost:5000`. You can change the port by modifying the `PORT` variable in your `.env` file.

3. **Verify Server Operation**:
   - Open a browser or API client (like Postman) and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/api/ducks` to test the API endpoints.

### Running the Client

1. **Navigate to the Client Directory**:
   - Open a new terminal window or tab and change to the `client` directory:
     ```bash
     cd client
     ```

2. **Start the Client**:
   - Start the React development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - By default, the client will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **View the Application**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application. The client communicates with the backend server to fetch and display data.

### Interacting with the Application

- **Frontend**:
  - The React application provides a simple interface with a button that, when clicked, fetches and displays a random duck from the library.

- **Backend**:
  - The Express server exposes the following API endpoints for managing the duck data:
    - `GET /api/ducks`: Retrieve all ducks from the database. The client uses this endpoint to fetch the list of ducks and select a random one.
    - `GET /api/ducks/:id`: Retrieve a single duck by ID.
    - `POST /api/ducks`: Create a new duck.
    - `DELETE /api/ducks/:id`: Delete a duck by ID.
    - `PATCH /api/ducks/:id`: Update a duck by ID.

As mentioned above, it is recommanded to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) app to test your api endponts.

### Stopping the Servers

- **Stop the Express Server**:
  - In the terminal where the server is running, press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server.

- **Stop the React Client**:
  - In the terminal where the client is running, press `Ctrl + C` to stop the client.

### Troubleshooting

- **Server Issues**:
  - Check the terminal for error messages and ensure your `.env` file is correctly configured.
  - Verify that MongoDB Atlas is running and accessible.

- **Client Issues**:
  - Ensure that the React development server is running and that you have no conflicting applications using port 3000.
  - Check the browser console for errors if the client is not displaying correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to run and interact with both the client and server components of the application effectively. If you encounter issues, refer to the troubleshooting tips or consult the documentation for more detailed guidance.
